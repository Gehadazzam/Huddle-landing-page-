What I learned
This project reinforced my understanding of CSS custom properties and responsive design principles. I learned how to effectively use Flexbox and CSS Grid to create a layout that adapts well to different screen sizes.

Here's a snippet of code I'm proud of:

html
Copy code

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
css
Copy code
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
js
Copy code
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
Continued development
In future projects, I aim to continue improving my skills in responsive design and explore more advanced CSS techniques, such as animations and transitions.
